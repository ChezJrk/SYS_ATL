## 1. Standard Python Future Import

```python
from __future__ import annotations
```

- **Purpose**: Enables postponed evaluation of type annotations, allowing you to use forward references in type hints without causing issues during runtime.
- **Context**: This is a standard Python feature that improves compatibility and performance when using type hints in your code.

---

## 2. Core Exo Module

```python
from exo import *
```

- **Purpose**: Imports all core functionalities from the Exo language.
- **Includes**: Fundamental classes and functions necessary for defining and manipulating high-performance computational kernels.

## 3. Memory Libraries

### 3.1 Importing `DRAM_STATIC`

```python
from exo.libs.memories import DRAM_STATIC
```

- **Purpose**: Provides access to a static DRAM memory model.
- **Usage**: Used for declaring and managing statically allocated memory regions in DRAM.

### 3.2 Importing Multiple Memory Classes and Errors

```python
from exo.libs.memories import MDRAM, MemGenError, StaticMemory, DRAM_STACK
```

- **Components**:
  - `MDRAM`: Multi-dimensional DRAM memory abstraction.
  - `MemGenError`: Exception class for memory generation errors.
  - `StaticMemory`: Base class for statically allocated memory types.
  - `DRAM_STACK`: Represents a stack allocated in DRAM.
- **Usage**: Facilitates advanced memory management and error handling in performance-critical code.

## 4. Platform-Specific Modules

### 4.1 x86 Platform Optimizations

```python
from exo.platforms.x86 import *
```

- **Purpose**: Imports optimizations and definitions specific to x86 architectures.
- **Usage**: Enables the generation of optimized code tailored for x86 CPUs, including SIMD instructions and cache management.

### 4.2 ARM NEON Platform Optimizations

```python
from exo.platforms.neon import *
```

- **Purpose**: Provides ARM NEON-specific functionalities.
- **Usage**: Allows for optimization of code on ARM architectures that support NEON instructions, enhancing performance on mobile and embedded devices.

---

## 5. Frontend Syntax Utilities

```python
from exo.frontend.syntax import *
```

- **Purpose**: Imports utilities for parsing and manipulating Exo's frontend syntax.
- **Usage**: Used when extending or customizing the language's syntax for domain-specific applications.

---

## 6. Standard Library Modules

### 6.1 Scheduling Utilities

```python
from exo.stdlib.scheduling import *
```

- **Purpose**: Provides functions for scheduling and transforming computational kernels.
- **Includes**: Loop transformations, tiling, unrolling, and other optimization techniques.

### 6.2 Standard Library Functions

```python
from exo.stdlib.stdlib import *
```

- **Purpose**: Imports standard library functions and classes.
- **Usage**: Offers a collection of common utilities and helpers used across various Exo programs.

---

## 7. External Interfaces

```python
from exo.libs.externs import *
```

- **Purpose**: Facilitates interaction with external libraries and functions not defined within Exo.
- **Usage**: Allows for the integration of external code, such as C functions or hardware-specific routines, into Exo programs.

---

## 8. API Cursors

```python
from exo.API_cursors import *
```

- **Purpose**: Provides cursor-based APIs for navigating and modifying code structures.
- **Usage**: Enables advanced code introspection and manipulation, useful for metaprogramming and automated optimizations.
