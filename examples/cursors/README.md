# Cursor step-by-step example!

Very simple example using the tile2D example (in the paper!)


This example demonstrates how to use Cursors to navigate and transform Exo object code.

Cursors allow you to select and refer to parts of the code such as expressions,
statements, and code blocks. They also support spatial navigation within a procedure
to proximate locations.

Key concepts covered:
- Finding cursors using patterns
- Navigating using cursors
- Applying scheduling primitives with cursors
- Forwarding cursors after transformations
