# Cursor Step-by-Step Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates a simple application of Cursors using the tile2D example (as shown in our ASPLOS '25 paper).

## Overview

Learn how to use Cursors to navigate and transform Exo object code. Cursors are powerful tools that allow you to:
- Select and reference specific code elements (expressions, statements, blocks)
- Navigate spatially within procedures
- Apply transformations to your code

## Key Concepts

This tutorial covers:
- Pattern-based cursor identification
- Cursor navigation techniques
- Applying scheduling primitives using cursors
- Cursor forwarding after code transformations

## Getting Started

To run this example:
```bash
exocc cursors.py
```

Notes:
- The tutorial uses the tile2D example for demonstration
- Focus is placed on fundamental cursor operations
